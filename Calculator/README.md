This is my first C++ project.
It is a simple terminal-based calculator that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations using switch-case:

- Addition

- Multiplication
- Division

If using an IDE:
1. Open 'calculator.cpp' in any C++ IDE (VS Code, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio)
2. Compile & Run
3. Follow the on-screen instructions
   
If using Terminal:
1. cd path/to/calculator
2. g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
3. ./calculator       # Linux/Mac
4- calculator.exe     # Windows

## Features
- Switch-case based operation
